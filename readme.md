# Oracle Spatial Functions
Although the sdo_geometry and sdo_lrs functions in Oracle are very powerful, I have found basic spatial operations to be quite lacking. This repository is intended to be a cookbook
of scripts for performing basic actions on Lines, Points, and Polygons.

These functions do not account for every type of geometry. Clean your data before adapting these scripts to your needs. The sdo_geometry object can be a real pain, and these scripts can
only hope to reduce that pain by so much.
